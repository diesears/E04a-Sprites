Hello! This is my first expirience with "sprites" in Python Arcade during my "Game Technology" course at Indiana University. The main task was learning about the different ways to display a sprite, and how to change its position on screen. Each file demonstrates different sprite features with increasing complexity, eventually leading to a sprite with the ability to track and follow mouse movements.
